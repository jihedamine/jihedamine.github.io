<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/">Latexdiff</a> is a free perl script that highlights what has been added and what has been deleted between two versions of a latex document.<br /><br />The script is used as follows: <br /><pre class="source-code"><code>latexdiff oldversion.tex newversion.tex &amp;gt; diffversion.tex<br /></code></pre><br />oldversion.tex is the old version of the latex document, newversion.tex is the newer one and diffversion.tex is a generated version that uses some custom latex commands to highlight the differences between the two documents passed as parameters.<br /><br />While preprocessing a document, Latexdiff script replaces the \^ escape character with a custom command \SUPERSCRIPT (or SUPERSCRIPTNB). In postprocessing, it reverts back to the \^ character.<br />However, as I am writing a latex document in french, I didn't mean to use ^ to write a superscript but to write the circumflex accent. For example, t\^{e}te meant tÃªte, not t<sup>e</sup>te.<br /><br />As a consequence, the generated diff document had errors everywhere  \^ was used to write circumflex accents.<br />To fix the issue, I simply commented, in the latexdiff script, the lines that switched between the \^ regular expression and the SUPERSCRIPT custom command.<br /><br />The following preprocessing instructions were commented: <br /><pre class="source-code"><code># Convert ^n into \SUPERSCRIPTNB{n} and ^{nnn} into \SUPERSCRIPT{nn}<br />s/\^([^{\\]|\\\w+)/\\SUPERSCRIPTNB{$1}/g ;<br />s/\^{($pat4)}/\\SUPERSCRIPT{$1}/g ;<br /></code></pre><br />And those postprocessing instructions were commented too: <br /><pre class="source-code"><code># Convert \SUPERSCRIPTNB{n} into ^n and \SUPERSCRIPT{nn} into ^{nnn}<br />s/\\SUPERSCRIPTNB{($pat0)}/^$1/g ;<br />s/\\SUPERSCRIPT{($pat4)}/^{$1}/g ;<br /></code></pre><br />Thus if you want to generate the diff between two latex documents containing circumflex accents, you can still use latexdiff. Just comment the conflictual instructions.
