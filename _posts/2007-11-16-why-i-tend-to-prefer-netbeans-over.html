Even though Eclipse is surely the dominant Java IDE in the market, there are some reasons that make me prefer Netbeans over it :<br /><br />* Netbeans is a coherent IDE : you don't have to check the dependencies for a plugin and the right version for every dependency to get it work (check GMF version, WTP version etc..). Plugins in Netbeans are supervised by the development team and integrate easily and very well in the current Netbeans version.<br /><br />* Netbeans works out of the box : The functionalities provided by Netbeans are available from the plugins manager. You just have to install/activate them and begin working. In Eclipse, there is the update center, but it is tougher to get a stabilized IDE with a set of complementary tools. Moreover, many valuable Eclipse plugins aren't in the Eclipse update site, but belong to independent enterprises.<br /><br />* Netbeans is free : Well, I know eclipse is free too, but a lot of the valuable plugins are commercial (UML, GUI design..). Even if free components in Netbeans don't offer all the functionalities the commercial plugins in Eclipse do, I prefer having an IDE dealing mainly with free plugins.<br /><br />* Netbeans is actively supported : Sun makes a lot of efforts to market Netbeans, so we have all kinds of tutorials, videos etc (Netbeans TV, Netbeans Magazine, Netbeans tutorials..) that are made by Sun. Eclipse tutorials and screencasts are numerous but they aren't supported by IBM so they are less coherent and less 'Enterprise quality' documents.<br /><br />*Netbeans is made by Sun, the Java inventor : Netbeans has recently been on the edge concerning innovative Java technologies (JSF, Java FX..). It is easily understandable as Sun is creating those technologies.<br /><br />*Netbeans integrates some nice productivity tools : Eclipse has better refactoring, but is beaten in other aspects by Netbeans who integrates GUI Builder Matisse, advanced JSF Web design, JUnit testing, Ant compiling and a Profiler in a user friendly manner.<br /><br />I know the debate is very heated about this topic. You can leave your opinions and comments either you prefer Eclipse, Netbeans or any other IDE.<br /><br />Edit in 1st March 2008 : After three months of heavily using Netbeans and then three others with Eclipse, I completely changed my mind. I currently consider Eclipse to be way more productive and feature-rich than Netbeans. Maybe I will write a new post to explain in detail what makes Eclipse superior to Netbeans in my opinion.

    Your reasons are fine. But are you more productive by using Netbeans? What are the things that make the difference when you&#39;re actually using it? I mean, you focus on installation and Sun related things, more than on usability and productivity.

    You are right, the reasons I gave focus more on assistance and ease of installation. But I&#39;m talking also about free/commercial plugins wich is an important aspect for me, being a computing student. In terms of productivity, I can&#39;t give my opinion as I didn&#39;t use both of them in heavy projects..

    I&#39;m going to go with JP a bit.<br>Too much focus on the install, which happens rarely, compared with the aspects of daily use.<br>To be fair, Eclipse has more download options now, which can make it more ready to use &quot;out of the box&quot;.<br>I&#39;ve used both IDE&#39;s and NetBeans is a fine IDE, it has improved greatly over the years. However, I tend to use Eclipse more and more just because it is more productive.<br>Sometimes its little things. One small example, the auto-complete feature in NetBeans doesn&#39;t add the import for the thing that it auto-completes, so you have to go through a 2nd step. The refactoring support built into Eclipse simply can&#39;t be beat. The next best is Idea&#39;s IntelliJ (but, all of its users swear its the best)<br><br>OTOH, a really good feature of NetBeans, is how ANT is completely integrated into the build process. It can be done with Eclipse but it isn&#39;t quite as smooth. Nowadays, I do my builds with Maven, so its less of an attractor.<br><br>If you are a new developer, NetBeans may be easier to get started with because it is chock full of wizards, and there are plenty of tutorials. However, once you get past all of that and focus on productivity, Eclipse will be the way to go.

    I&#39;ve worked with both and besides performance I will also take Netbeans over Eclipse. <br>When working on medium project Netbeans behave badly and something will pause for seconds (if not minute). <br>Anyway it is good to see Netbeans team are actively improving it and the support forum is very helpful.

    To be honest, I&#39;ve only used Netbeans (5.5) for a single project the last summer (to develop a JavaME application).<br>A good point for Netbeans already cited is it&#39;s great visual tools and wizards. I was really impressed by the mobile apps visual editor and it helped me a lot in finsihing the thing quickly.<br>But when it comes to coding, IMO, eclipse is far away from Netbeans (The autocomplete feature: especially the order of the elements, the refactoring tools, the code generation features: constructors, surround with, etc.).<br><br>That was my 2-cents.

    As a beginner in java I&#39;ve tried eclipse it&#39;s a bit too complicated for me. So now I&#39;m learning Netbeans ( so my blog <a href="http://netbeans-tutorial.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://netbeans-tutorial.blogspot.com/</a>) and it seems easier.<br><br>I&#39;ve already tried Netbeans a few years ago and was upset by the lack of functionalities, slopiness and unstability. Today functionalities are very good (not yet as good as Visual Studio though but nearly :) ), it&#39;s stable but still very slow (clicking on a tree node takes so long same for just creating a property)

    I myself bought myeclipse. But where I make my money, i made my employer buy IntelliJ. There is no more productive and intuitive environment for me. IntelliJ just plain works and works seemlessly. It&#39;s costly. And as I said, when I voted with my own dollars, I went with MyEclipse, but IntelliJ is an amazing environment.

    I find some of your reasons for choosing NetBeans over Eclipse curious. You say that you believe IDE choice is a &quot;heated debate&quot; and presumably aren&#39;t looking to fan the flames given that you&#39;d only be encouraging people to repeat what they&#39;ve said in other arguments, and yet some of the reasons you give for choosing NetBeans are easily challenged.<br><br>Point 1: Other than having to add repositories for specific plugins (which allows plugin providers to manage their own repositories, rather than relying on a benevolent Sun Microsystems), adding plugins in Eclipse is pretty straightforward. If you select a plugin, it automatically selects those that it depends upon (cf linux&#39;s apt-get system).<br><br>Point 2: Eclipse does work &quot;out of the box&quot; depending on what you want to do. The only plugin I find I have to add (and it&#39;d be nice if it were included by default, I&#39;ll admit) is Subclipse for Subversion. I work on JavaSE in distributed system with SWT GUIs - everything <b>I</b> need is there. Obviously you have different requirements - but so does the next guy, so I don&#39;t see it as a particularly strong argument for or against it. My point is that it&#39;s fine as a personal argument but it&#39;s not a generalised argument and I can&#39;t see the value in mentioning it.<br><br>Point 3: NetBeans is free. You say yourself that Eclipse is free! Perhaps with time as NetBeans gains ground you&#39;ll find that more commericial vendors will create for-cost NetBeans plugins. Eclipse is sufficiently popular that for-cost plugins are a viable market - NetBeans just isn&#39;t that popular yet. Perhaps you&#39;ll have to stop using NetBeans in the future because it has too many commericial plugins (let&#39;s hope!).<br><br>Point 4 is your first good point and I agree with you wholeheartedly. What you miss out on with a single organisation in control is the variety of input. I may be mistaken but I thought Eclipse and NetBeans had been around for roughly the same amount of time, but Eclipse supports many more languages than NetBeans and until the work on JRuby support, building support for other languages has been pretty difficult (indicated by the lack of languages). Even groovy doesn&#39;t get a guernsey!<br><br>Point 5 is fine too. NetBeans is in a better position to pick up on new Sun technologies. Sun can start building NetBeans plugins for technologies they haven&#39;t even announced yet. If you&#39;re really into these new technologies (e.g. JavaFX) then I guess NetBeans is going to be preferred.<br><br>Point 6 is fair too, but it&#39;s unfair to imply that Eclipse doesn&#39;t have JUnit and Ant support out of the box, which is definitely does. It&#39;s like saying &quot;I like Toyota cars better than Mitsubishis because they have wheels&quot;.<br><br><br>Anyway, I don&#39;t have a problem with your reasons, but I can&#39;t really see the point of putting them out there given little is added to the overall consensus on the matter of IDE choice.<br><br>My main problem with NetBeans is the fact that you&#39;re limited to one run configuration at a time. Eclipse lets you have as many run configurations as you like, each able to run a different main() with different command-line parameters, etc. The last time I used NetBeans (6.0b1) it still seems to force you to pick one project as the main project, and then you have one run configuration that you can run. Any time you want to change parameters you have to do it manually rather than being able to keep them (point me to any docs that can help me on this, btw, in case I&#39;ve missed something).

    I prefer Netbeans. I used JBuilder for many years but it is no longer supported and I had to move; I tried Eclipse twice but couldn&#39;t stand it. Gtting Eclipse configured was a nightmare. The on line built in documentation/help was very poor. I have a large screen 1600+x1200 and wanted to increase the help font size. It depended very deeply on Microsoft operating system settings and messed up many programs when I tried to change the font size. I have since used Netbeans very successfully in porting a Tomcat based JSP servlet web app from JBuilder.

    Spanky, I appreciate that you took the time to comment in detail on my post. Nevertheless, the title of my post is very clear. In fact, it is : Why <strong> I </strong> and <strong> tend </strong> to prefer Netbeans. It means those are reasons that make <strong> me </strong> prefer Netbeans over Eclipse. The title isn&#39;t &#39;Why Netbeans is better than Eclipse in everything and for everyone&#39;. So, I can understand very well that you have a different point of view and it&#39;s nice to have many IDEs for many tastes. Concerning the points you found not so true, I re-read them and honestly, I think they are objective and they do make sense and I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this way (more coherent, less configuration to get things to work, some  better  integrated tools, and still essentialy free plugins (maybe this will change in the future but I&#39;m speaking about the actual situation). Anyway, as I said before, I&#39;m not trying to say Netbeans is superior to Eclipse, I just list some things I like about Netbeans. To conclude, it is beneficial to Java community to have great IDEs such as Eclipse, Netbeans or Intellij, giving us a large choice of quality platforms.

    I gave up on eclipse years ago. I don&#39;t write Java for a living, but java is my current language of choice and am studying for my certification. That said, NetBeans has REALLY come a long way, and it&#39;s a very nice IDE. In fact I tried them both side by side about 6 months ago and I found NetBeans to be superior - although I&#39;m not using it on a large project.

    I still prefer NetBeans even after having to get a Java Training on Eclipse. Eclipse has been my first IDE but that was only official. All my practice has went into NetBeans and with NetBeans I have been able to study different frameworks with a lot of ease. I had tried Eclipse Europa thinking that it would turn out more friendlier but it didnt.

    I agree mostly. Especially the about the GUI and UML tools. The free UML tools for Eclipse are not even close to Netbeans&#39; UML tools&#39; quality. Matisse also is superior to Eclipse&#39;s Visual editor.

    I agree with the author. I came into this page after searching on how to import a netbean project to eclipse. My experience is that there is no help on it.. Lot of procedures and confusing.. while the reverse process can be done easily..<br><br>Eclipse is for sure good.. and thats why i was going to try it.. But to try it and make it work for the first time.. it may take ages.. No official support which states how to do it. I was doing J2me project and its not even compiling.. I know its my fault, as i might have done something wrong... but no help.. no good article so no idea on what to do..

    I  use both Eclipse 3.3 and Netbeans 6.1. Both are good in certain features. Netbeans 6.1 has a better support for latest version of specifications. But eclipse is more elegant to use.<br>NetBeans hangs sometimes [responsiveness is slower than Eclipse]. <br><br>But overall I prefer NetBeans 6.1 when it comes to learning new Java JEE related technologies.

    Ok, I&#39;m starting to program on Java. I was programing on C++. Furthermore, I&#39;m starting on Linux to program Bioinformatics. Thanks a lot, with this forum I decided to prove Netbeans.

    Missing run configurations: This stopped me from using NetBeans, too. But meanwhile it is integrated :-D

    Well I think everyone will have his preference. <br>I like the concept offered by Eclipse but I must say<br>that I find more confortable with Netbeans because I<br>find it more instinctive then more easy not only for installation but also for use
